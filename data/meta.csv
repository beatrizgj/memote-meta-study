    Expect all non-exchange reactions to have a GPR rule.

    Gene-Protein-Reaction rules express which gene has what function.
    The presence of this annotation is important to justify the existence
    of reactions in the model, and is required to conduct in silico gene
    deletion studies. However, reactions without GPR may also be valid:
    Spontaneous reactions, or known reactions with yet undiscovered genes
    likely lack GPR.

    Expect a model to have a metabolic coverage >= 1.

    The degree of metabolic coverage indicates the modeling detail of a
    given reconstruction calculated by dividing the total amount of
    reactions by the amount of genes. Models with a 'high level of modeling
    detail have ratios >1, and models with a low level of detail have
    ratios <1. This difference arises as models with basic or intermediate
    levels of detail are assumed to include many reactions in which several
    gene products and their enzymatic transformations are ‘lumped’.

    Expect all metabolites to have charge information.

    To ensure that reactions are charge-balanced, all model metabolites
        ought to be provided with a charge.

    Expect a single non growth-associated maintenance reaction.

    The Non-Growth Associated Maintenance reaction (NGAM) is an
    ATP-hydrolysis reaction added to metabolic models to represent energy
    expenses that the cell invests in continuous processes independent of
    the growth rate.

    Expect the model to contain at least one biomass reaction.

    The biomass composition aka biomass formulation aka biomass reaction
    is a common pseudo-reaction accounting for biomass synthesis in
    constraints-based modelling. It describes the stoichiometry of
    intracellular compounds that are required for cell growth.

    Expect all reactions to be able to carry flux.

    Blocked reactions are reactions that during Flux Variability Analysis
    cannot carry any flux while all model boundaries are open. Generally
    blocked reactions are caused by network gaps, which can be attributed
    to scope or knowledge gaps.

    Expect no stoichiometrically balanced loops to be present.

    Stoichiometrically Balanced Cycles are artifacts of insufficiently
    constrained networks resulting in reactions that can carry flux when
    all the boundaries have been closed.

    Expect that the stoichiometry is mass-balanced.

    Stoichiometric inconsistency violates universal constraints: the
    positivity of molecular masses and the mass conservation for each
    reaction. A single incorrectly defined reaction can lead to
    stoichiometric inconsistency in the model and consequently to
    unconserved metabolites.
